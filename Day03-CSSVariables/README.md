## New  knowledge:
**CSS Variables** are entities defined by CSS authors which contain specific values to be reused throughout a document. They are set using custom property notation (e.g. --main-color: black;) and are accessed using the var() function (e.g. color: var(--main-color);).

**data-* global atributes** form a class of attributes called custom data attributes, that allow proprietary information to be exchanged between the HTML and its DOM representation by scripts.

**HTMLElement.dataset** property allows access, both in reading and writing mode, to all the custom data attributes (data-) set on the element, either in HTML or in the DOM.
