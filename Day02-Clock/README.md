> 14 July 2017

The design is mine. Also I changed hands' animation ( I used @keyframes and animation steps to do this)

## New  knowledge:
**newDate()** if no arguments are provided, the constructor creates a JavaScript Date object for the current date and time according to system. settings.

**transform origin** property lets you modify the origin for transformations of an element.

**animation: steps()** is a timing function that allows us to break an animation or transition into segments, rather than one continuous transition from one state to another.
