## New  knowledge:
**the HTMLMediaElement.currentTime** property gives the current playback time in seconds. Setting this value seeks the media to the new time.

**transitioned event** is fired when a CSS transition has completed. In the case where a transition is removed before completion, such as if the transition-property is removed or display is set to "none", then the event will not be generated.

**arrow function** has a shorter syntax than a function expression and does not bind its own this, arguments, super, or new.target. These function expressions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.
