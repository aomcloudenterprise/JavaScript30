## A new knowledge:
- **the HTMLMediaElement.currentTime** property gives the current playback time in seconds. Setting this value seeks the media to the new time.
[mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/currentTime)
- **transitioned event** is fired when a CSS transition has completed. In the case where a transition is removed before completion, such as if the transition-property is removed or display is set to "none", then the event will not be generated. [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/transitionend)
- **arrow function** has a shorter syntax than a function expression and does not bind its own this, arguments, super, or new.target. These function expressions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.
